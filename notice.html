        <h3>Amnesia Closing Festival to be headlined by The Chemical Brothers</h3><br>
        <p><strong>The epic 12 hour party is set for Saturday 15 October.</strong></p>

          <div class="clearfix">

            <img class="imagen" src="images/chemical.jpg" alt="">
            <p><p>Critically acclaimed dance music outfit The Chemical Brothers have been unveiled as the first act for Amnesia's Closing Festival. The duo will play an Ibiza-exclusive DJ set on Saturday 15 October for the club's final party of 2022.</p> <br>
    
                <p>Transcending the underground to pop culture, together Ed Simmons and Tom Rowlands might be the most decorated act in the history of dance music.</p><br>
                
                
                <p>More accustomed to festival stages and arena tours, this is a rare opportunity to see them play a club set.</p><br>
                
                <p>Although they are the only name announced so far, Amnesia never disappoints with its line-up and we're confident the rest of the bill will follow suit.</p><br>
                
                <p>So there we have it, our first closing party announcement of 2022.</p><br>
                
                <p>Amnesia's closing is always one for the books. This 12 hour marathon serves as a mutual "thank you" between club and punters alike. This announcement just adds an extra layer of appeal.</p><br>
                
                <p>More line-up news coming soon, but if this is enough for you, then head below and grab yourself a bargain.</p>

        <h3>Berghain might be closing ‘by the end of 2022’</h3><br>
        <p><strong>The club’s booking agency has already ceased operations</strong></p>
        <img class="imagen" src="images/berghain.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
          <p>Berghain is rumoured to close its doors for good by the end of this year.</p><br>
          
          <p>The legendary Berlin institution, which has been open since 2004, has been the topic of speculation following the shock closure of its in-house record label and booking agency Ostgut Ton earlier this month.</p> <br>
          
          <p>According to Faze Magazine, several inside sources at the club have since confirmed its closure later this year. “The Berghain is closing forever – the final end will come this year,” one source alleges.</p> <br>
          
          <p>“One of the founders has already been paid out and is said to be staying in the countryside in Brandenburg,” another inside source said. “The others simply ‘don’t feel like it’ anymore and have other life plans in mind.” According to the source, Berghain’s “chapter should finally be closed” with no further variations of the club, by the end of this year.</p></p>

      <h3>The best things to watch at the Amsterdam dance event 2022</h3><br>
      <p><strong>We take a closer look at some of the Conference and Lab sessions at this year’s ADE</strong></p>
      <img class="imagen" src="images/ade.jpg" alt="">
      <p><p>The arrival of October signals the return of the world’s premier electronic music conference and festival Amsterdam Dance Event.</p><br>

        <p>If you’ve somehow got to this stage in your life without becoming aware of its existence, ADE takes place between the 19th and 23rd of October, unsurprisingly in Amsterdam, Holland and is a five-day event that engages with every imaginable aspect of electronic music and the surrounding culture.</p><br>
        
        <p>It’s split into four sections: the Pro Conference which is aimed at the business side of the industry, The Lab for aspiring producers, an arts and culture programme and the festival programme.</p><br>
        
        
        <p>This year’s ADE festival features 2500 artists and DJs from across pretty much every genre and sub-genre you can think of, playing in nearly 200 venues across the city.</p><br>
        
        <p>Confirmed artists include Blawan, Martin Garrix, Suzanne Ciani & Metropole Orkest, DJ Stingray, Jayda G, Eric Prydz, Don Diablo, Paula Temple, Hardwell, Fatima Hajji, Flava D, Holy Other, The Blessed Madonna, Nils Frahm, Peggy Gou, Honey Dijon, Âme and Richie Hawtin to name just a few.</p><br>
        
        <p>It’s a pretty packed week so we thought we’d take a closer look at some of the Conference and Lab events going on this year and pick out just a few choice sessions.</p></p>

      <h3>Arturia announce Minifreak, Minilab 3 & More</h3><br>
      <p><strong>The French behemoth has announced a huge sway of new gear expanding their preexisting lines.</strong></p>
      <img class="imagen" src="images/arturia.jpeg" alt="">
      <p><p>Arturia has made a mammoth announcement of four new products. The company announced them on a Livestream on their YouTube channel. Below is a round-up of what’s new in the Arturia arsenal.</p><br>

        <p>
          MINIFREAK:
          A much-loved synth, the MicroFreak has now been redesigned with its baby sister the MiniFreak. The new edition is a polyphonic hybrid keyboard that combines two digital sound engines with warm analog filters, playful modulation, and spontaneous sequencing with rich stereo sound. Beautiful and chaotic.
        </p><br>
        
        <p>Comes with a dedicated VST counterpart also.</p><br>
        
        <p>
          AUGMENTED GRAND PIANO:
          The next edition in their Augmented Series is Augmented Grand Piano. As one would expect from the Augumented Series, it’s a mix of high-quality piano samples with modern synth engines. This has worked for them on other instruments so should work on the keys too. From first impressions, it sounds great.
        </p><br>
        
        <p>Piano house is about to get augmented.</p><br>
        
        <p>
          MINILAB 3 MIDI CONTROLLER:
          It’s hard to go overly excited about MIDI controllers but at least with MiniLab you are in safe hands. The MiniLab 3 is the next-generation MiniLab plug-and-play MIDI controller that combines a great keyboard, flexible pads, faders, and knobs, and a premium software bundle with seamless DAW integration that lets users get creative right out of the box.
        </p><br>
        
        <p>Simple easy and trustworthy.</p><br>
        
        <p>
          MINIFUSE 4:
          The theme of the day is opening up, or augmenting, Arturia’s preexisting range. The MiniFuse, a popular interface in the Attack office, has also had a reboot.
        </p><br>
        
        <p>Capture crystal-clear recordings, refine with pro-grade creative software, and make music happen with a 4-in/4-out interface that ticks all the boxes: best-in-class audio, expanded connectivity, a 5-year warranty, and a world-class suite of software titles for modern music production. Plus all the premium software you need, from Ableton Live Lite, to Analog Lab Intro, to Native Instruments Guitar Rig 6.</p></p>
